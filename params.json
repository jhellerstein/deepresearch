{"name":"d^p","tagline":"data to the people","body":"_Facilitating interactions between people and data throughout the analytic lifecycle._\r\n\r\nData analysis is an inherently human process, involving creative collaborations over time and distances. The dp (“deep”) project is a collaboration aiming to better enable people and data to work together over time, in settings ranging from Internet companies to enterprises to rural healthcare facilities. The problem is inherently multifaceted, a mix of issues in data management, statistical methods, scalable systems and human-computer interaction.\r\n\r\n### People\r\n#### Faculty\r\n* [Jeff Heer](http://hci.stanford.edu/jheer/), Stanford\r\n* [Maneesh Agrawala](http://vis.berkeley.edu/~maneesh/), Berkeley\r\n* [Joe Hellerstein](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/), Berkeley\r\n* [Tapan Parikh](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~parikh/), Berkeley\r\n\r\n#### Students\r\n| Stanford | Berkeley |\r\n| -------- | -------- |\r\n| [Philip Guo](http://www.stanford.edu/~pgbovine/) | [Kuang Chen](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~kuangc/)\r\n| Sean Kandel | [Nicholas Kong](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~nkong/)\r\n| Diana MacLean | * [Wesley Willett](http://vis.berkeley.edu/~willettw/portfolio/)\r\n| Ravi Parikh |\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\nWe are grateful to our research sponsors:\r\n\r\n* EMC/Greenplum\r\n* Lightspeed Venture Partners\r\n* National Science Foundation\r\n* SurveyMonkey, LLC\r\n* Yahoo!
